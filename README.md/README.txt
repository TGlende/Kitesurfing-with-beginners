(This project was born for educational purposes)

Based on the assumption that people who get started with kitesurf might not be able to correctly read a weather forecast 
or simply overestimate their capabilities, this model is meant to issue a "warning" when the conditions are unfit. 

We picked Cape Town and specifically Big Bay beach to conduct our analysis and create the model.
